# Flexbox Layout Project

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates basic usage of **CSS Flexbox** for creating:
1. A multi-item horizontal layout (`#outer`).
2. A simple navigation bar (`#outer-nav`) with logo and links.

---

## 📂 Files

- **index.html**  
  Contains the HTML structure with two sections:
  - A group of lettered boxes (A to I) in a flex container.
  - A basic navigation bar with links (Logo, Home, About, Contact).

- **flex.css**  
  External CSS file linked in the HTML. It is used to apply Flexbox styling to both containers.

---

## 🧰 Features

- Responsive layout using `display: flex`.
- Horizontally aligned items.
- Clean structure for practicing Flexbox properties.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure `index.html` and `flex.css` are in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. You'll see:
   - A flex row of boxes labeled A–I.
   - A navigation bar with logo and links.

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

- Modify the number of items or their content inside `#outer` to experiment with wrapping and spacing.
- Use different `justify-content` or `align-items` properties to understand Flexbox behavior.

## 📚 Learning Outcome
